# hx markdown editor

I do a lot of writing in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and I usually use [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for that.

Besides that I also use my normal editors for it: VSCode and Sublime.

But wouldn't it be awesome to have that all in one?

That's the itch and this is how I scratch that!

## WIP

Almost everything is `wip` but this one is more.

Contribute if you like, I will update when I feel more itches.


## Haxe

This is a [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) project, read more about it in the [README_HAXE.MD](README_HAXE.MD)!
