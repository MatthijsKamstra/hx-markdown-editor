# hx markdown editor

I do a lot of writing in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and I usually use [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for that.

Besides that I also use my normal editors for it: VSCode and Sublime.

But wouldn't it be awesome to have that all in one?

That's the itch and this is how I scratch that!
