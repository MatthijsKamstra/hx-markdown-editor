# hx markdown editor

I do a lot of writing in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and I usually use [Macdown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for that.

Besides that I also use my normal editors for it: VSCode and Sublime.

But wouldn't it be awesome to have that all in one?

That's the itch and this is how I scratch that!

## WIP

Almost everything is `wip` but this one is more.

Contribute if you like, I will update when I feel more itches.

## Improvement

I have looked at the editors that I use (for coding and writing)

- vscode
- sublime text
- macdown

And want to take the good parts and intergrate them:

- [X] editor short cuts
- [X] Fullscreen editing
- [X] Status bar
- [X] Preview mode
- [X] distraction free edit
- [X] toggle preview
- [ ] subtle markdown styling (preview is full styling)
- [ ] edit more then one file (tabs)
- [ ] export to different files (html/pdf/rich text/etc)
- [ ] snippets
- [ ] Spell check
- [ ] folder stucture (might be usefull with a lot of files in one folder...)
- [ ] Windows support for Keymaps (can't test this, but might be usefull for others)
