# basic format

Test the keyboard shortcuts

- bold (strong): `cmd` + `b`
- italic (emphasis): `cmd` + `i`
- inline code: `cmd` + `k`
- comment: `cmd` + `\`

this is bold aka strong

and this is italic aka emphasis

maybe try some inline code

or a comment that fails



just because we can
- one
- two
